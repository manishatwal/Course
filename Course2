Module: Divide and Conquer Algorithms

This module introduced me to the divide-and-conquer strategy, where problems are broken into smaller subproblems.  
I learned how this approach is used in classic algorithms like Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Binary Search.  
The recursive nature of these algorithms helped me understand how problems can be solved more efficiently through problem decomposition.  
It improved my ability to think recursively and solve problems in a structured way.
