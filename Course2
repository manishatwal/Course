This module helped me understand the importance of version control and how tools like Git and GitHub make collaboration easier.  
I learned how to create a project using version control, manage branches, and revert to stable versions when needed.  
It also introduced me to the world of open-source contribution, showing how I can work on real-world projects and grow my professional network.  
I now see how open source can boost my career by helping me understand production-level code and gain recognition in the tech industry.
